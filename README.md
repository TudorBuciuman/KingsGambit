## Personal Experience
The idea for King Gambit was inspired by my love for chess which started in the spring of 2023 and a desire to create a platform where both casual players and enthusiasts can enjoy a rich chess experience. Seeing my friends and family engage with the game, especially during private matches, has been incredibly rewarding. Their positive feedback and the fun we had during mini-games encouraged me to develope and improve King Gambit.
