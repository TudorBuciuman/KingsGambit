## Features

- Advanced Chess AI: Play against a sophisticated AI that adapts to different skill levels, providing a challenging experience for all players. The code for optimizing the millions of searches that increase exponentially with each level of difficulty is personally created by me, having already had experience in the level of exponential searches. As a result of this algorithm, the game can offer relaxing games, with fast and smart moves to provide the player with a unique experience. 
- Multiplayer mode: Connect with other players through a secure multiplayer server. Use private codes to invite friends to a private match.
- Mini-games: Participate in a variety of mini-games designed to improve your chess tactics and keep the game exciting.
- Intuitive interface: Enjoy an easy-to-use interface that makes navigation and gameplay relaxing.



## Install

The game is lightweight and can run on almost all devices, even on Androids with version above 5.1. Also, the RAM consumption is highly optimized and can run on older devices.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TudorBuciuman/KingsGambit.git

3. Build and run:

## Multiplayer configuration 

One of the main parts of the game is the multiplayer setup, which consists of a multiplayer match finder, where you can show your level against other players. Another feature is the private match lobby, where you can create or join matches with your friends and, if you wish, customize the chessboard. The matches follow the FIDE chess rules.

1. Online match search
- press the multiplayer button and we will find you an opponent.
2. Create a private match:
- Launch the application.
- Navigate to the multiplayer section.
- Generate a private code and share it with your friend.
3. Private matches:

## Tehnologies
- Frontend:

- Networking:
Photon Unity Networking (PUN) 2: Provides the framework for multiplayer features, ensuring seamless matchmaking and real-time gameplay, with updates even when disconnected.

All assets, except for the part models (which I will edit later), are hand-crafted.

## My opinion
The idea for King Gambit was inspired by my love of chess, which began in the spring of 2023, and the desire to create a platform where both casual and enthusiast players can enjoy a rich chess experience. Seeing my friends and family engage with the game, especially during private matches, was incredibly satisfying. Their positive feedback and the fun I had during the mini-games encouraged me to develop and improve King Gambit.
